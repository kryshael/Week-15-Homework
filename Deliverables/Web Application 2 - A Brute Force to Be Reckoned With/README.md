### Mitigation Methods

- Require complex usernames and passwords.

      - For example, require the user to include special characters, upper and lowercase, and numbers in the username and password.
    
- Lock out accounts after a number of failed attempts.
    
      - For example, after three failed login attempts, the user's account gets locked.
    
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    
      - For example, require users to have a password and a secondary form of authentication, like a pin generated by an external token
  
  - *Note that it is beneficial to apply all of these forms of mitigation together.*
