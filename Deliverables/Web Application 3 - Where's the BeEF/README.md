### Mitigation Methods
<br/><br/>
- **Education**
  - Teach your users how to recognise strange links and how to identify phishing emails. Help them understand that the company stays in business because outsiders can't access confidential documents.
- **Policy**
  - Enforce good user behaviour by asserting certain practices and limitations in your company policy. Make every user read and sign a copy. Remember that this policy must not be full of jargon - the average person in your business has to be able to fully comprehend it. Include reasons for policies, too.
- **Patching**
  - Keep up to date on all patches for your browser, plugins (e.g. Flash), OS and applications (PDF reader, Office, etc.).
- **Configuration**
  - Alter the security settings on your browser to prevent JavaScript and plugins by default. You could use AdBlock and NoScript to help reduce your attack surface.
- **Protection**
  - Use an anti-malware solution and a firewall on every machine. Pick an AV that's relatively lightweight - the detection rates don't vary much between the major vendors. If you're not keen on AV products, at least install Microsoft Security Essentials. Either way, keep the AV and firewall up to date.
- **Sandbox**
  - Use a sandboxing tool to isolate individual processes when dealing with untrusted data. This is especially useful and convenient when dealing with things like PDFs, where you don't make any changes to the system.
- **Scanning**
  - Upload untrusted executables and documents to an AV aggregation tool. This gives you a good early warning if the file is infected.
